This is the thrid time I re-write my blog from scratch. Or forth?

I tried Makefile - to its extremes (dear god those regexes). Then nodejs with
express, producing very unpleasant code and finally python with flask producing
way more than I need. After a lot of thought, I went with `staticjinja` and it
really rocks. I hope you like the design and I hope I'll sit my ass down and
write a post or two per month.

Until then, my [GitHub](https://github.com/dzervas) is almost always active
with various stuff. I suggest you take a look on
[RSPET](https://github.com/dzervas/rspet), a simple post exploitation toolkit
in python that I'm very proud of and
[pocketgame](https://github.com/dzervas/pocketgame), a cute little bluetooth
game controller using just an AVR and a BT module - compatible with most
systems

Have fun and code on!
